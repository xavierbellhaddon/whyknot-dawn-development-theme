WhyKnot Naturals is an all-natural hair and body care product company that is owned and                operated by myself and my husband Gerald. It began in 2015, when I was looking for affordable products                with natural ingredients that would work with the dense, kinky texture of my hair&#8212products that would counteract                its natural dryness, leaving it soft, rejuvenated, and moisturized. I searched high and low, until one day I was                inspired to launch a product line of my own. WhyKnot offers a variety of items that are 100% free of harsh                chemicals and dyes, and will increase hair growth, retention, and health. Our products are designed for all types of hair,                from straight to curly and everything in between. Thank you so much for taking the time to check us out! Love you,                and God bless.<\/p>",
